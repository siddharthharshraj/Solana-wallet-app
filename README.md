# Solana Token Transfer App

## Overview

I developed an application that allows users to transfer SOL tokens from one account to another using the Phantom wallet. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in interacting with Solana wallets, sending/receiving tokens, and tracking transactions using the Solana Explorer.

## Features

- **Connect Phantom Wallet**: Securely connect the user's Phantom wallet to the app.
- **Transfer SOL Tokens**: Facilitate the transfer of SOL tokens between accounts.
- **Transaction Tracking**: View transaction details and statuses on the Solana Explorer.

## Learning Outcomes

### 1. Interacting with Phantom Wallet

- Established a connection between the app and the Phantom wallet.
- Implemented functionality to access wallet details and balances.

### 2. Sending/Transferring Tokens

- Used Solana's web3.js library to handle token transfers.
- Created a user interface for entering recipient addresses and transfer amounts.
- Managed transaction signing and submission through the Phantom wallet.

### 3. Viewing Transactions on Solana Explorer

- Provided links to the Solana Explorer for tracking transaction statuses.
- Enabled real-time updates for transaction confirmations.

## Technologies Used
